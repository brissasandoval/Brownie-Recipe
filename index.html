        <h2> <strong> Just 8 ingredients needed: </strong> </h2>
    <nav> 
        <ul> 
            <li><strong> Sugar: </strong> These easy brownies start with two cups of white sugar. </li>
            <li><strong> Flour: </strong> 1 1/2 Cups of All-purpose </li>
            <li><strong> Butter: </strong> Two sticks of melted butter give the brownies moisture and richness. </li>
            <li><strong> Eggs: </strong> 4 eggs lend even more moisture. Plus, they help bind the batter together. </li>
            <li><strong> Cocoa powder: </strong> Of course, you'll need 1/2 cup of cocoa powder for chocolate brownies! </li>
            <li><strong> Vanilla: </strong>  1 teaspoon of vanilla extract enhances the overall flavor of the brownies. </li>
            <li><strong> Baking Powder: </strong> 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder acts as a leavener, which means it helps the brownies rise. </li>
            <li><strong> Salt: </strong> A pinch of salt (1/2 teaspoon) enhances the flavors of the other ingredients. </li>

        </ul>
